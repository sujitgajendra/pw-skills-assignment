TASK 2:
Problem Statement:
Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.
solution.Absolute and relative positioning are two CSS positioning properties used to control the placement of elements within
the layout of a web page. They have different behaviors and are used for distinct purposes:
(a)Absolute Positioning:
   - Elements with absolute positioning are positioned relative to their closest positioned ancestor, which means the element's
position is determined by the nearest parent element that has a `position` property other than `static`. If no such ancestor exists,
it's positioned relative to the initial containing block, usually the viewport.
   - Absolute positioned elements are taken out of the normal document flow, which means they don't affect the positioning of other
elements, and other elements don't affect them.
   - You can use properties like `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` to specify exactly where the element should be positioned
relative to its containing ancestor or the viewport.
   - Useful for creating overlays, pop-up menus, or elements that should be precisely positioned on the page.
(b)Relative Positioning:
   - Elements with relative positioning are positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow.They still occupy space
in the document flow, and other elements are positioned as if the relative-positioned element were in its original place.
   - When you apply relative positioning and use properties like `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`, you move the element from its
original position while still preserving the space it occupies.
   - Relative positioning is often used when you want to nudge an element slightly from its default position without affecting
the layout of surrounding elements.
