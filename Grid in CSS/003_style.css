/* This example creates a grid container with three columns defined by grid-template-areas. The first row is
displayed with a height of 50px because we have mentioned grid-template-rows for the first row as 50px. And
the remaining rows will be displayed with a height of 100px, because of the grid-auto-rows:200px property.
That's why the second row is displayed with a height of 200px. */
