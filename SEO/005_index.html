    <!-- A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is a small, often square-shaped graphic icon associated with a website or web page.
    Favicons are typically displayed in web browser tabs, bookmarks, and other places within the browser's user interface.
    They serve as a visual representation of the website and help users identify and distinguish between different websites 
    when multiple tabs or bookmarks are open. -->
