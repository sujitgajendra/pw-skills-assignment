1.What is SEO and explain the importance of SEO?
Ans.SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a set of techniques and strategies aimed at improving a website's visibility and
ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). The primary goal of SEO is to increase organic (non-paid) traffic to a website
by optimizing various aspects of the site to make it more search engine-friendly.
The Importance of SEO:
(a)Increased Visibility: SEO helps your website appear in prominent positions on search engine results pages.
This increased visibility can drive more organic traffic to your site.
(b)Credibility and Trust: Websites that rank well in search results are often perceived as more credible and trustworthy by users.
A high search ranking can positively impact your brand's reputation.
(c)Cost-Effective Marketing: Compared to paid advertising, SEO can provide a cost-effective way to attract organic traffic.
Once your website ranks well, you can continue to receive traffic without ongoing advertising costs.

3.What are the benefits of using meta tags.
Ans.Meta tags are HTML elements that provide metadata about a web page. While they don't have a direct impact on how a page
is displayed to users, they play a crucial role in how search engines and social media platforms interpret and present your content.
The benefits of using meta tags are:
(a)Improved Search Engine Visibility: Meta tags, particularly the meta title and meta description, influence how your web pages
appear in search engine results pages (SERPs). A well-optimized meta title and description can encourage users to click on your link,
improving click-through rates (CTR). This, in turn, can positively affect your search engine rankings.
(b)Clear and Informative Summaries: The meta description tag provides a concise summary of what a web page is about. 
When done effectively, it helps users quickly understand the content and relevance of your page. This can lead to more qualified traffic,
as users who click on your link are more likely to be interested in your content.
(c)Branding and Consistency: Meta tags allow you to reinforce your brand by using consistent messaging and branding elements
in your meta titles and descriptions. This can contribute to a more cohesive online presence and better user recognition.
(d)Social Media Sharing: When someone shares a link to your web page on social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter, 
meta tags play a critical role in determining how the content appears in the shared post. Well-optimized meta tags can result
in more engaging and informative social media shares, which can increase click-through rates and engagement.
(e)Accessibility: Some meta tags, such as the meta viewport tag, help improve the accessibility and mobile-friendliness of your website.
Ensuring that your website is accessible and displays properly on various devices can enhance the user experience and
expand your potential audience.
