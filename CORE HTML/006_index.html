                             The browser does not need to ask server time for every task. This is especially helpful when a user needs to perform these calculations repeatedly.
                              In these cases, connecting to the server would take a lot more time than performing the actual calculations.</li>
                        <li>JavaScript is very useful while using forms. It has the capability to validate user input for errors and also saves time.
                             If the user leaves a required field empty or the information is incorrect,
                              JavaScript checks for them before sending the data over to the server.</li>
